**Project Title:** Revenue at Risk: How External Factors Influence Patagonia’s Performance
**Research Question:** To what extent do external risk factors (climate change, raw material costs, consumer demand shifts) affect Patagonia’s revenue?

## Context
* Patagonia is a privately held outdoor apparel company known for its sustainability focus. While its mission prioritizes environmental responsibility, it also faces exposure to external risks that directly impact revenue performance. Climate change may alter seasonal demand and disrupt supply chains, raw material costs (cotton, wool, polyester) can fluctuate sharply, and consumer preferences are shifting toward sustainable products and away from fast fashion.
* For Patagonia’s leadership and analysts, quantifying these risks is essential for strategic planning, financial resilience, and sustaining the company’s long-term mission.

## Stakeholders
* Decision Makers
    * **Chief Financial Officer(CFO):** Needs to understand revenue sensitivity to external shocks for financial planning and budgeting.
    * **Chief Sustainability Officer(CSO):** Aligns business strategy with climate risks and consumer sustainability expectations.
* Users

    * **Financial Planning & Analysis (FP&A) Team:** Uses models to forecast revenue under different risk scenarios.
    * **Risk Management Team:** Monitors exposure to commodity price spikes and climate disruptions.
    * **Marketing & Consumer Insights Team:** Analyzes demand shifts and tailors strategy toward sustainable product lines.

## Decisions at Stake
* **Financial:** How to allocate budgets and set revenue targets under uncertain market conditions.
* **Operational:** Whether to adjust sourcing strategies (e.g., alternative materials to mitigate raw material risk).
* **Strategic:** How to balance Patagonia’s sustainability commitments with financial resilience.

## Why This Matters
* Patagonia’s brand and mission depend on long-term stability. Without understanding how external risks affect revenue, the company risks underestimating vulnerabilities that could reduce financial capacity for sustainability initiatives. This project will provide data-driven insights into which factors matter most, enabling Patagonia to make informed strategic and operational decisions.
